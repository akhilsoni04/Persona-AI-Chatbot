# 🤖 Personality AI Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot that responds with a consistent personality using Large Language Models (LLMs), Prompt Engineering, and FastAPI.

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of AI application development by building a chatbot that behaves like an AI Mentor rather than a generic assistant.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Most chatbots generate generic responses. This project introduces the concept of personality-driven AI by using system prompts to guide the behavior, tone, and teaching style of the model.

The chatbot acts as an AI Mentor that:

* Explains concepts in simple language
* Uses beginner-friendly examples
* Breaks complex topics into smaller steps
* Provides educational and encouraging responses
* Maintains a consistent mentoring personality

This project serves as a foundational step toward building advanced AI systems such as RAG applications, AI Agents, Tool-Calling Agents, and Multi-Agent Systems.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Understand how LLM APIs work
* Learn Prompt Engineering fundamentals
* Build a FastAPI backend
* Create a frontend chat interface
* Implement personality control using system prompts
* Understand request-response architecture in AI applications

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

Understanding how AI models generate responses.

### Prompt Engineering

Controlling AI behavior using carefully designed instructions.

### System Prompts

Defining chatbot personality and response style.

### API Integration

Sending requests and receiving responses from an LLM.

### Client-Server Communication

---

## 📌 Example Conversation

### User

```
What is an API?
```

### AI Mentor

```
Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant.

You tell the waiter what you want, the waiter takes your request to the kitchen, and then brings back the food.

Similarly, an API allows different applications to communicate and exchange information.
```

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Never commit API keys to GitHub.
